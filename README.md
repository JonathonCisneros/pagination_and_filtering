# Pagination and Filtering by Jonathon

This program paginates and filters a long list of students. Each "page" contains only 10 students per "page". The pagination links are dynamically added with the function appendPageLinks which then calls the other functions to begin this program.

## Submission Notes
* For some reason, when last page link is clicked, an error occurs (but does not affect the program) saying, "Cannot read property 'classList' of undefined." This may be because there are only four students in the last page. My function tries to read the "remaining six students" that do not exist in the last page.
* This was a tough challenge, but fun!
* Enjoy!
